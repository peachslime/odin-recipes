<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>Here is a list of things to make the most incredible vareniki.</p>
<h4><b>For the dough:</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sour cream</li>
    <li>3/4 cup water + 1 1/4 cup 2% milk, or use 1 cup water + 1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>5 cups all-purpose flour, plus 1 cup more for dusting</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>For the filling:</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Potato & onion</li>
    <li>Blueberry</li>
    <li>Cherry</li>
    <li>Ground pork and turkey</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to Perfect Vareniki</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together egg and sour cream until well combined.</li>
    <li>Whisk in 1 1/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup water.</li>
    <li>Using a spatula, mix in four, 1 cup at a time.</li>
    <li>Place the dough onto a floured surface. Using a food scarper, knead the dough by turning and folding it with the food scraper. Dust the dough with flour as you need it until it is soft and doesn't stick to your hands (you'll need around 1 cup more flour). Knead for 6 to 8 minutes. Don't add too much flour or the dough will become hard to work with.</li>
    <li>Place the dough under a bowl and let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough into 4 to 6 pieces. Work with one piece at a time and keep the rest covered with plastic wrap.</li>
    <li>Form your chunk of dough into a log and cut off small pieces, one at a time. Pieces should be a little larger than a gumball. Dust your rolling pin and cutting board with flour and roll out a piece of dough until it is 1/8" thick and 3" diameter.</li>
    <li>Fill these circles with the desired filling (potatoes, cherries, blueberries or meat). Fold the dough over the filling to form a crescent and seal the edges tightly with your fingers. If making pelmeni (meat filling), pinch the two edges together to form a "diaper" shape. Place the finished pierogis on a cutting board dusted with flour until ready to boil.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. As you finish the first batch of pierogies, place them in boiling water. After they float to the top, cook about 2 to 3 minutes more, then remove them with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drizzle the pierogies with melted butter.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 7 through 9 with the rest of the dough.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
<p>To freeze the pierogies, place them on a cutting board and stick them in the freezer uncovered. Once they are frozen, transfer them to a large freezer-safe ziploc bag and dust generously with flour. They stay perfect for months.</p>
